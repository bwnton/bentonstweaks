### Overview
Hi friends!

This is the new home of the "Benton's Tweaks" resource pack for Minecraft Java Edition. (Hopefully it'll be easier then just sending the file to different people everytime I update it.)

Below is some useful information, please read it before downloading or contacting me.
#
### 💁🏼‍♂️ What are "Benton's (Vanilla) Tweaks"?
Good question. These tweaks are little upgrades to the vanilla Minecraft textures and resources that are based on the [original Vanilla Tweaks website](https://vanillatweaks.net/) but have my own personal flair. AKA stuff I've compiled from different resource packs, textures and changes I've made myself, and ala-carte textures/ideas from the Minecraft community. Credits are appropriately given in the "credits.txt" file. 

The goal of this resource pack is to change aspects of Minecraft, but keep it feeling like the vanilla game. 
#
### ❓How to Install
Download it. Unzip it. Open your Resource Pack folder. Move it. Select it (in game). 
#
### 💾 Versions
I will update the pack as often as I feel like it. To see the change log of each version, head over to the 'releases' tab. pLeAsE be sure that you're downloading the version of the pack that lines up with the version of Minecraft you're playing. (I'm not going to upload versions before 1.14, so contact me if you want 1.12 or 1.13)
